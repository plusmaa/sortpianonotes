This Bash script sorts and renames files in a specified directory based on piano note sequences (e.g., C4, A#0). 

It handles both sharp and natural notes, extracting the note and octave from the start of each filename to determine 
its correct musical order. 

Files are then renamed with a numerical prefix indicating their sorted position. 
It's ideal for organizing musical samples or any files named after piano notes.

Usage: ./sort_piano_notes.sh /path/to/your/files
